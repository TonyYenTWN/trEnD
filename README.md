# trEnD: Model for Transition of End-users and the Distribution Power Network
Welcome to trEnD, a c++ based model of the energy transition, focusing on the end-users and the distribution network. The source codes are currently undergoing revision and being tested by real data of Norway in my phD project. Feel free to comment on any issues.

Currently 3 external libraries are used in the source codes of the model. The library [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) and [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) are required to compile the source codes. The library [ALGLIB](https://www.alglib.net/) is already in the source codes so you need not to download it in addition.
